Blinken’s trip follows the decision by President Biden on Wednesday to bring all remaining 2,500 U.S. troops home and end a conflict that has bedeviled his predecessors for the past two decades. Despite their long-standing concerns about a U.S. departure, Afghanistan’s leaders publicly embraced Biden’s decision and thanked officials for their coordination ahead of the announcement. In a meeting room in Kabul’s ornate presidential palace, Ghani told Blinken, “We respect [President Biden’s] decision and are adjusting our priorities.” In his meeting with Abdullah, the chairman said the withdrawal merely represented a new “chapter” in the U.S.-Afghan relationship. Blinken said he “wanted to demonstrate with my visit the ongoing commitment of the United States to the Islamic Republic and the people of Afghanistan.” “The partnership is changing but the partnership itself is enduring,” he said. Biden will withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, 2021 Looming behind every discussion in Afghanistan is the specter of a possible Taliban takeover of Kabul following the U.S. departure in the fall. For years, the United States tried and failed to apply military and political pressure in Afghanistan in hopes of persuading the Taliban to forge a resolution with the U.S.-backed Afghan government. With few options left, U.S. officials hope that a decisive withdrawal may jump-start the peace process rather than push the country further into violence as some have forecast. The meeting with Afghan officials face-to-face won’t be easy, said analysts. “No matter how you slice it, the withdrawal announcement will be hard for many Afghans to accept. There’s no way to sugarcoat a policy decision that’s quite likely to worsen instability in a country that has been at war for 40 years,” said Michael Kugelman, an Afghan scholar at the Wilson Center. “U.S. officials’ best bet is to assure Kabul and the Afghan people that a military withdrawal does not equate to a total abandonment,” he added. That’s precisely the message a senior State Department official said would be conveyed. “The American commitment is strong; we’re ending our direct military role, but that doesn’t mean we’re ending our relationship,” the official said. Following his meetings with Ghani and Abdullah, Blinken met with members of Afghan civil society, including journalists, a member of parliament and women’s rights leaders who stand to be affected by the U.S. departure. While waiting for Blinken to arrive, Afghanistan member of parliament Naheed Farid expressed concern about the future of her country. “My views are very pessimistic,” she said, without elaborating. Ahead of the meeting, the State Department official acknowledged that the civil society leaders “will be apprehensive about what will change” as U.S. and NATO forces exit the country. “Already they’re in a challenging position,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive political situation. “There’s a war going on right now. There have been targeted killings in the past month or so. Some of [the killings] done by the Taliban, some of them by done by the [Islamic State].” The stop in Afghanistan is an important step in what the Biden administration is calling a responsible winding down of the conflict. Blinken flew to Afghanistan from Brussels, where he and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made the case to European and Canadian allies that it was time to bring the 10,000-strong NATO mission to a close, a pitch that garnered unanimous support from the 30-member military alliance. In remarks at NATO headquarters, Blinken and Austin said the United States will continue to pay the salaries of Afghan security forces, help them maintain counterterrorism capabilities and provide significant humanitarian and economic assistance to the country. “We’ll continue support for the rights of Afghan women and girls, minorities advocating for their meaningful participation in the ongoing negotiations and their equal representation throughout society, and we’ll maintain significant humanitarian assistance to those in need,” Blinken said. During a press conference in Kabul, Blinken was asked how the United States will avoid a redux of the late 1980s, when the West largely forgot about Afghanistan following the Soviet Union’s withdrawal. Blinken said the difference is the U.S. will not forget, and he reiterated his vow to provide “support” to the Afghan military and civil society while applying diplomatic pressure to bring countries in the region together to “advance peace.” While Afghanistan’s leaders put a positive spin on the U.S. decision, Blinken, too, glowingly praised the economic and cultural progress in Afghanistan in recent years despite its crippling poverty, endemic corruption and recurring violence. In a meeting with U.S. soldiers at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Blinken noted their achievements. “What you and your predecessors did over the last 20 years is really extraordinary,” he said. A key challenge for U.S. officials has been trying to midwife peace talks between the Taliban and the U.S.-backed Afghan government. The stalemated discussions are supposed to resume in coming days in Istanbul. The Biden administration’s decision to withdraw prompted immediate criticism from Republican leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina, who argued that the U.S. would lose its leverage to force concessions from the Taliban. Biden took on those criticisms in his speech on Wednesday, saying time has proved such arguments to be wrong. “I know there are many who will loudly insist that diplomacy cannot succeed without a robust U.S. military presence to stand as leverage,” Biden said. “We gave that argument a decade. It’s never proved effective — not when we had 98,000 troops in Afghanistan, and not when we were down to a few thousand.”","1":"The United States is on track to have gathered an oversupply of hundreds of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses as soon as July, even while many countries in the developing world will have to wait years to vaccinate a majority of their populations, according to a report by the Duke Global Health Innovation Center. The new estimates, included in the paper alongside recommendations, come as the Biden administration faces mounting pressure to facilitate equitable vaccine distribution around the world. The United States has pledged money to the global immunization effort, but has resisted calls to share vaccine technology or donate surplus doses. On Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a fundraising event for Covax, a World Health Organization-backed push to distribute coronavirus vaccines, particularly to low- and middle-income countries, and called on other nations to do more.","2":"Facebook’s Oversight Board decided Wednesday to uphold Facebook’s and Instagram’s suspension of former President Donald Trump from their platforms. This decision is the wrong one, and one that all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, should be concerned about. However, the Oversight Board was entirely appropriate to admonish Facebook for the fact that its penalty was vague and standardless. Big Tech companies should not be allowed to play by a set of rules that give them undue influence over American society while also avoiding any accountability for how they use that influence. It is time for Congress to act and reform Section 230—which protects publishing platforms from being held liable for content posted by users—in a way that respects the rights of those engaged in private enterprise. True reform must also ensure that companies like Facebook and Instagram take responsibility for the choices they make—especially when it comes to censoring individuals and opinions they don’t like. Letting politically motivated companies police themselves as they manipulate civic discourse is not a long-term solution consistent with America’s values. Whether it’s the president of the United States or an average American citizen in Des Moines, Big Tech should not have the ability to suppress viewpoints it finds objectionable—and it certainly shouldn’t have the ability to hide behind outdated laws in justifying such behavior. Censorship is a threat to our American republic, and woke corporations like Google, Twitter, and Facebook should not be allowed to engage in such behavior without consequence. This decision concerns one individual, but we all know that if Big Tech continues to feel emboldened to silence a sitting president, they can and will silence the rest of us. While the Oversight Board has spent the past few months deliberating whether Facebook and Instagram should grant a democratically elected president access to their platforms, these companies have allowed dictatorial, adversarial regimes in China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea to pump out propaganda on those same platforms. Big Tech companies have put their hypocrisy on full display and, as a result, have lost the public’s trust. There are ways for these companies to remove truly objectionable, obscene, and inciting content from their platforms, and there are ways Congress can and should change the law to allow them to do so. However, as these woke corporations continue to swing the sword of censorship, we will fight back. Big Tech faces a choice: Work to reform Section 230 and treat users with consistency and transparency now, or face more dire policy consequences in the future.","3":"Donald Trump remains banned from Facebook Inc.’s global echo chamber, and that’s a good thing. After the social media company banned him in January for inciting a deadly insurrection at the Capitol, its Oversight Board — the outside group the company established to monitor controversial content and arbitrate thorny issues such as Trump’s exile — said Wednesday that his history of violence disqualified him for the time being. “The Board found that, in maintaining an unfounded narrative of electoral fraud and persistent calls to action, Mr. Trump created an environment where a serious risk of violence was possible,” a summary of the decision noted. The board also took Facebook itself to task, saying that “it was not appropriate for Facebook to impose the indeterminate and standardless penalty of indefinite suspension.” It pointed out that Facebook typically penalizes rule-breakers by removing content, imposing suspensions with a clear time frame or permanently disabling an account. It called on the company to remedy confusing guidelines for how its rules are applied against any of its users, with special, but not exclusive, care given to how influential political leaders are treated. The board told Facebook it had six months to “reexamine the arbitrary penalty it imposed” on Trump and craft a new one commensurate with “the gravity of the violation and the prospect of future harm.” I hope when the time comes, Trump’s ban becomes permanent. If we’ve learned anything about the former president, it’s that he isn’t just your average political speaker. He’s a ringleader. And he’s unhinged and manipulative enough to use platforms such as Facebook to do serious harm. Had Trump been reinstated, his Facebook feed would most likely have featured familiar menu items: self-regard, pitches for money and his business, darts aimed at critics, disinformation, and appeals to bigotry, racism and other bile. He would have also occasionally encouraged his most dedicated followers to rise up and demand what’s theirs. Trump loyalists and free-speech purists will certainly savage the board’s ruling. The loyalists, who are still playing down the events of Jan. 6 while embracing Trump’s big lie that the 2020 election was stolen, are the easiest to dismiss. Suppressing Trump, they argue, is evidence of their favorite myth — so-called cancel culture. Facebook has it out for them. In the real world, far-right outlets that engage in the heaviest flame-throwing, such as the Daily Wire and Fox News, continue to enjoy the greatest engagement on Facebook. There’s more nuance — and philosophic trapdoors — on the free-speech side of the ledger. Yet where Trump resides in that world is clear, too. Our laws protect vigorous reporting and intense scrutiny of public figures while limiting, for example, protection for certain obscenities and for “fighting words.” And by fighting words, the courts have meant the kind that instill or incite hatred or violence. Has any public figure of the modern era in the U.S. deployed fighting words to such disastrous effect as Trump? Free speech is a contingent right, and Trump’s desire to incentivize his gladiators doesn’t outrank democracy, tolerance, personal and public safety, and other virtues. The Oversight Board’s ruling is consistent with how the courts weigh rights to speech against calls to violence. If the board had given Trump a second chance, it also would have been a reminder of how poorly Facebook has policed its ubiquitous platform and how much the board appears to be a well-meaning and lushly funded fig leaf. Trump’s proclivity for violence didn’t suddenly emerge on Jan. 6, after all. He reveled in promoting violence during rallies as a presidential candidate in 2016, and violence followed. He refused to initially condemn white nationalist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017; blamed the media after one of his supporters sent pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and news organizations in 2018; and suggested shooting undocumented migrants at the U.S. border in 2019. Last year, amid the Covid-19 outbreak, he encouraged protesters to march against state governments mandating lockdowns; armed protesters followed suit in Lansing, Michigan. He and his campaign encouraged his “army” to take to the streets before the November election last year. Facebook and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, equivocated about all of this. It wasn’t until Trump told his supporters to “fight like hell” on Jan. 6, and they went on to break into the Capitol, that Facebook took action and barred him. And then it deferred to its Oversight Board on the next steps. But the Oversight Board’s mandate is narrow (my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Noah Feldman, who is a Harvard Law School professor, helped design it). It has operational independence and a generous budget of its own, but it can rule only on whether a small portion of the tsunami of content produced on Facebook violates the company’s standards. That might be a step in the right direction if Facebook only published content. The company does much more than that, of course. It runs a machine that encourages intense engagement among its users, and its algorithms then help highly engaging content to take flight. An outside body that only monitors a fragment of problematic cases but isn’t empowered to examine and challenge how Facebook circulates and amplifies vitriol that helps foster sprawling communities of conspiracy theorists or disseminate disinformation is merely a placeholder — and not, as Facebook would have it, a countervailing force. I imagine that Zuckerberg would never have allowed the Oversight Board to exist if it had been constituted to be more effective. Because Facebook’s business model — the one it sells so profitably to advertisers — is built on engagement, it has shied away from pulling the plug on some of its most engaging content. An internal study it commissioned reported in 2018 that Facebook exacerbated tribalism and division among its users — behaviors that boost engagement. Facebook buried the study.","4":"Americans are split on whether former President Donald Trump should be barred from social media. Some 49% of U.S. adults say Trump’s accounts should be permanently banned from social media, while half say they should not be. But views are deeply divided along partisan lines, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.  The survey, fielded April 12 to 18, was conducted before Facebook’s independent oversight board upheld for now the suspension of Trump’s account that was instituted in the wake of the violent riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Several social media companies acted against Trump after the attack, claiming he violated their terms of use and that his rhetoric could result in more violence. Republicans and Democrats hold deeply contrasting views of a lifetime ban for Trump. Just 11% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say Trump’s accounts should be permanently banned from social media, while 88% say they should not be. By comparison, 81% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say his accounts should be banned permanently. Roughly one-in-five Democrats (18%) do not support this type of ban on Trump’s accounts.  While most Republicans do not support permanently barring Trump from social media, there are some ideological differences within the party. More than nine-in-ten conservative Republicans (95%) believe Trump’s accounts should not be permanently banned from social media, but that share is lower among moderate and liberal Republicans (77%). Among Democrats, liberals (85%) are somewhat more likely than conservatives and moderates (78%) to favor a permanent ban, though large majorities in both ideological groups favor it. The Center’s new poll follows a January survey that gauged public reactions to the initial bans that social media companies imposed on Trump after the Capitol riots. In that survey, 58% of adults said they thought social media companies’ decisions to ban Trump’s accounts in the wake of the riots were the right thing to do, while 41% believed those decisions were the wrong thing to do. And then – just like today – most Republicans (78%) said social media companies’ decisions to ban Trump’s accounts following the riots were the wrong thing to do, while a vast majority of Democrats (89%) supported these decisions. Facebook created its oversight board in 2019 to be the final arbiter of important, controversial content decisions made by the platform. It began making decisions earlier this year. The board recently ordered Facebook to reinstate a post that accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of participating in efforts to kill the country’s Sikh religious minority.","5":"This Mother’s Day, I would like to take a moment to congratulate all the moms who made this past year possible. Of course, I know it wasn’t just mothers. Fathers, guardians, caregivers and more made this possible, but Sunday is Mother’s Day so I would like to focus on the moms. A year ago March, I had just flown back from New York and Washington, D.C., where I would fly twice a month to do Fox programs on set. The school notified us by email that we needed to pick our children up, with all of their things (backpacks, school supplies, computers), because they would be shutting the school down due to this new virus that was going around called COVID-19.   To be honest, I thought the children would be home two or three weeks max, then back to school and back to normal life as we knew it. Boy, was I wrong! It would be a year or longer for most. I am sure many of you have experienced some of what I went through; some of you much more. I would like to list a few of the challenges we moms faced this past year during the pandemic. Although a painful reminder for some, hopefully one that is in our rearview mirror forever. The day after I picked my children up at school, they had to start attending school online. This was a challenge as I am technologically not inclined, perhaps even techno phobic. The children were also not accustomed to a class via zoom.  There were distractions, such as our dog barking and needing attention, my children arguing that one could hear the other’s classmates, the temptation of hitting up the pantry or the fridge too much and the temptation of YouTube, Netflix, Facetime all during class. As one child recently told President Biden, online learning was an opportunity to nap during school at times.  And then there was the internet. Or lack of. Once my children and I finally got the handle on the new school online schedule and the various ways one submits classwork (Zoom, Google Classroom, Membean and more), there were Wi-Fi issues.  In our home, this caused an issue for my job. ","6":"Antolini, the author of “Memorializing Motherhood: Anna Jarvis and the Struggle for Control of Mother’s Day,” talked to Vox about the origins of the holiday: [Jarvis] selected the second Sunday in May because it marked the anniversary of her mother’s death and she wanted Mother’s Day to always fall on the Sabbath. Her vision of motherhood stayed constant through the years for a couple of reasons. “A lot of it is that Anna herself never marries or has children. She has no idea what motherhood means from the eye of the mother,” Antolini says. “It was very much seeing motherhood through the eyes of a child.” Jarvis retreated from her mother’s socially conscious vision for Mother’s Day in favor of one that idolized the mother’s individual role. Jarvis’ Mother’s Day celebration soon spread to other cities. In 1914, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson issued a presidential proclamation to officially establish Mother’s Day as a national holiday.  Wilson invited the American public to display flags “on the second Sunday in May as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country.” Flowers, Cards, and Commercialization. In the first few years after Jarvis’ 1908 Mother’s Day celebration, she promoted the holiday by, for instance, lobbying florists and card companies to promote the holiday. While these efforts largely helped Jarvis achieve her goal of establishing a national holiday, she would later speak out against the commercialization of Mother’s Day. ","7":"The Biden team has hired a slate of immigration judges initially selected during the Trump era, angering advocates who argue the White House is already failing to deliver in its pledge to push back against the prior administration's shaping of the judiciary.The first 17 hires to the court system responsible for determining whether migrants get to remain in the country is filled with former prosecutors and counselors for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as a few picks with little immigration experience. Almost none have made their career representing migrants in court.The Thursday announcement from the Department of Justice (DOJ) initially perplexed immigration attorneys, advocates and even some former immigration judges who wondered why the group so closely mirrored the jurists favored by the Trump administration.“The 17 new immigration judges referenced in the notice all received their conditional offers under the prior administration,” a Justice Department spokesperson told The Hill.Critics said the Biden administration has an obligation to fully vet the judges hired under their watch and rebalance a court system heavily shaped by the Trump team.It’s also a surprising move for a president that has otherwise sought to quickly reverse a number of Trump immigration policies while calling for a more humane response to migration.“This is a list I would have expected out of Bill Barr or Jeff Sessions, but they're not the attorney general anymore. Elections are supposed to have consequences,” said Paul Schmidt, now an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law School after 21 years as an immigration judge. That included time serving as the chair of the Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest administrative body dealing with immigration cases.“No one on that list is among the top 100 asylum authorities in the country, and that's the kind of people they should be hiring — not prosecutorial re-treads,” he added. Under the Trump administration, the Justice Department, which oversees the immigration court system, filled roughly two-thirds of the 520 seats on the bench, often picking those with long careers in ICE who argue in favor of deporting people.“The Trump administration was very astute when it came to the importance of who sits on the bench. That was as true of the Supreme Court as it was all of the federal circuits and the federal district courts, and to their immense credit they did not have a blind spot for the immigration court,” said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a professor at the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law.“I think it's important for the administration actually putting these individuals on the bench to decide if they have the information they need to make this decision or delay the process or to take ownership for making these appointments,” he added. Biden’s budget calls for hiring 100 new immigration court judges — a figure many argue will hardly make a dent in a backlog of 1.3 million cases that will take an estimated four years to get through.And his designated White House counsel wrote in a letter to lawmakers in December seeking suggestions for who to nominate to the bench, writing that they were “focused on nominating individuals whose legal experiences have been historically underrepresented on the federal bench, including ... those who represent Americans in every walk of life.”For many, that means the immigration court system needs to be filled with more immigration defenders.“The bottom line is that the president has been clear and forceful that he wants to put judges on the bench with diversity that had been lacking in past, and that’s not just in terms of race and other markers but that diversity in professional background is just as important,” said Peter Markowitz, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.“You can’t just have judges that were former prosecutors,” he added. “We need former defense attorneys and other actors in the legal system represented on the bench as well.”A failure to do so under the Trump administration has led to an imbalance in the system, García Hernández said.“People who work as immigration lawyers and immigration defense lawyers develop a different perspective than people that work as immigration prosecutors,” he said.Some of that can be seen in the number of asylum case denials, which surged under Trump as judges denied petitions from those arguing they would face danger if they returned to their home country due to things like their race, religion or political beliefs. Denial rates that had hovered around 50 percent under prior administrations jumped closer to 70 percent.“All but one of these new judges were former prosecutors, law enforcement, or in other branches of government, demonstrating a clear lack of diversity and little change from hires made under the Trump administration whose bench had the highest rate of asylum denials in history at 72 percent,” Greg Chen, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told The Hill by email.“The Biden administration is rushing to hire more judges to address the massive 1.3 million backlog in cases, but on its own more judges won’t fix the fundamental lack of fairness in the immigration courts which is why Attorney General [Merrick] Garland must immediately institute reforms to restore the court’s integrity,” he said.DOJ pushed back against criticism that the new judges would contribute to a pattern of rulings that favor government attorneys over immigrants, saying it “takes seriously any claims of unjustified and significant anomalies in adjudicator decision-making and takes steps to evaluate disparities.”“Note also that the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) continually evaluates its processes and procedures to ensure that immigration cases are adjudicated fairly, impartially and expeditiously and that its immigration judges uniformly interpret and administer U.S. immigration laws,” the spokesperson said.• Jacobin writer: Biden extending elements of Trump's 'war on asylum'• Biden's relationship with top House Republican is frostyBut Schmidt said diversifying the attorneys on the bench is what will be needed to have a greater impact.“You need to get some progressive immigration experts into the system who recognize what good asylum claims are who can establish precedent for granting cases and then move those cases through the system,” he said.“I haven't seen much evidence to back up their initial claim they want to be fair and just to asylum seekers. It’s just Stephen Miller Lite.”"},"link":{"0":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/2021\/04\/15\/afghanistan-us-troops-blinken\/","1":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/world\/2021\/04\/15\/united-states-vaccine-sharing\/","2":"https:\/\/www.dailysignal.com\/2021\/05\/05\/heritage-president-oversight-board-is-wrong-to-uphold-facebooks-suspension-of-trump\/","3":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/opinion\/articles\/2021-05-05\/trump-facebook-ban-is-upheld-keep-it-that-way","4":"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2021\/05\/05\/americans-divided-on-whether-trump-should-be-permanently-banned-from-social-media\/","5":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/opinion\/mothers-day-covid-struggle-loss-survival-leslie-marshall","6":"https:\/\/www.snopes.com\/news\/2021\/05\/06\/origins-of-mothers-day\/","7":"https:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/national-security\/552373-biden-fills-immigration-court-with-trump-hires"},"category":{"0":"Asia","1":"World","2":"Commentary","3":"Opinion","4":"Face

social media, while half say they should not be. but views are deeply divided along partisan lines, according to a new pew research center survey.  the survey, fielded april 12 to 18, was conducted before facebook’s independent oversight board upheld for now the suspension of trump’s account that was instituted in the wake of the violent riots at the u.s. capitol on jan. 6. several social media companies acted against trump after the attack, claiming he violated their terms of use and that his rhetoric could result in more violence. republicans and democrats hold deeply contrasting views of a lifetime ban for trump. just 11% of republicans and republican-leaning independents say trump’s accounts should be permanently banned from social media, while 88% say they should not be. by comparison, 81% of democrats and democratic leaners say his accounts should be banned permanently. roughly one-in-five democrats (18%) do not support this type of ban on trump’s accounts.  while most republicans do not support permanently barring trump from social media, there are some ideological differences within the party. more than nine-in-ten conservative republicans (95%) believe trump’s accounts should not be permanently banned from social media, but that share is lower among moderate and liberal republicans (77%). among democrats, liberals (85%) are somewhat more likely than conservatives and moderates (78%) to favor a permanent ban, though large majorities in both ideological groups favor it. the center’s new poll follows a january survey that gauged public reactions to the initial bans that social media companies imposed on trump after the capitol riots. in that survey, 58% of adults said they thought social media companies’ decisions to ban trump’s accounts in the wake of the riots were the right thing to do, while 41% believed those decisions were the wrong thing to do. and then – just like today – most republicans (78%) said social media companies’ decisions to ban trump’s accounts following the riots were the wrong thing to do, while a vast majority of democrats (89%) supported these decisions. facebook created its oversight board in 2019 to be the final arbiter of important, controversial content decisions made by the platform. it began making decisions earlier this year. the board recently ordered facebook to reinstate a post that accused indian prime minister narendra modi of participating in efforts to kill the country’s sikh religious minority.","5":"this mother’s day, i would like to take a moment to congratulate all the moms who made this past year possible. of course, i know it wasn’t just mothers. fathers, guardians, caregivers and more made this possible, but sunday is mother’s day so i would like to focus on the moms. a year ago march, i had just flown back from new york and washington, d.c., where i would fly twice a month to do fox programs on set. the school notified us by email that we needed to pick our children up, with all of their things (backpacks, school supplies, computers), because they would be shutting the school down due to this new virus that was going around called covid-19.   to be honest, i thought the children would be home two or three weeks max, then back to school and back to normal life as we knew it. boy, was i wrong! it would be a year or longer for most. i am sure many of you have experienced some of what i went through; some of you much more. i would like to list a few of the challenges we moms faced this past year during the pandemic. although a painful reminder for some, hopefully one that is in our rearview mirror forever. the day after i picked my children up at school, they had to start attending school online. this was a challenge as i am technologically not inclined, perhaps even techno phobic. the children were also not accustomed to a class via zoom.  there were distractions, such as our dog barking and needing attention, my children arguing that one could hear the other’s classmates, the temptation of hitting up the pantry or the fridge too much and the temptation of youtube, netflix, facetime all during class. as one child recently told president biden, online learning was an opportunity to nap during school at times.  and then there was the internet. or lack of. once my children and i finally got the handle on the new school online schedule and the various ways one submits classwork (zoom, google classroom, membean and more), there were wi-fi issues.  in our home, this caused an issue for my job. ","6":"antolini, the author of “memorializing motherhood: anna jarvis and the struggle for control of mother’s day,” talked to vox about the origins of the holiday: [jarvis] selected the second sunday in may because it marked the anniversary of her mother’s death and she wanted mother’s day to always fall on the sabbath. her vision of motherhood stayed constant through the years for a couple of reasons. “a lot of it is that anna herself never marries or has children. she has no idea what motherhood means from the eye of the mother,” antolini says. “it was very much seeing motherhood through the eyes of a child.” jarvis retreated from her mother’s socially conscious vision for mother’s day in favor of one that idolized the mother’s individual role. jarvis’ mother’s day celebration soon spread to other cities. in 1914, u.s. president woodrow wilson issued a presidential proclamation to officially establish mother’s day as a national holiday.  wilson invited the american public to display flags “on the second sunday in may as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country.” flowers, cards, and commercialization. in the first few years after jarvis’ 1908 mother’s day celebration, she promoted the holiday by, for instance, lobbying florists and card companies to promote the holiday. while these efforts largely helped jarvis achieve her goal of establishing a national holiday, she would later speak out against the commercialization of mother’s day. ","7":"the biden team has hired a slate of immigration judges initially selected during the trump era, angering advocates who argue the white house is already failing to deliver in its pledge to push back against the prior administration's shaping of the judiciary.the first 17 hires to the court system responsible for determining whether migrants get to remain in the country is filled with former prosecutors and counselors for immigration and customs enforcement (ice) as well as a few picks with little immigration experience. almost none have made their career representing migrants in court.the thursday announcement from the department of justice (doj) initially perplexed immigration attorneys, advocates and even some former immigration judges who wondered why the group so closely mirrored the jurists favored by the trump administration.“the 17 new immigration judges referenced in the notice all received their conditional offers under the prior administration,” a justice department spokesperson told the hill.critics said the biden administration has an obligation to fully vet the judges hired under their watch and rebalance a court system heavily shaped by the trump team.it’s also a surprising move for a president that has otherwise sought to quickly reverse a number of trump immigration policies while calling for a more humane response to migration.“this is a list i would have expected out of bill barr or jeff sessions, but they're not the attorney general anymore. elections are supposed to have consequences,” said paul schmidt, now an adjunct professor at georgetown law school after 21 years as an immigration judge. that included time serving as the chair of the board of immigration appeals, the highest administrative body dealing with immigration cases.“no one on that list is among the top 100 asylum authorities in the country, and that's the kind of people they should be hiring — not prosecutorial re-treads,” he added. under the trump administration, the justice department, which oversees the immigration court system, filled roughly two-thirds of the 520 seats on the bench, often picking those with long careers in ice who argue in favor of deporting people.“the trump administration was very astute when it came to the importance of who sits on the bench. that was as true of the supreme court as it was all of the federal circuits and the federal district courts, and to their immense credit they did not have a blind spot for the immigration court,” said césar cuauhtémoc garcía hernández, a professor at the university of denver’s sturm college of law.“i think it's important for the administration actually putting these individuals on the bench to decide if they have the information they need to make this decision or delay the process or to take ownership for making these appointments,” he added. biden’s budget calls for hiring 100 new immigration court judges — a figure many argue will hardly make a dent in a backlog of 1.3 million cases that will take an estimated four years to get through.and his designated white house counsel wrote in a letter to lawmakers in december seeking suggestions for who to nominate to the bench, writing that they were “focused on nominating individuals whose legal experiences have been historically underrepresented on the federal bench, including ... those who represent americans in every walk of life.”for many, that means the immigration court system needs to be filled with more immigration defenders.“the bottom line is that the president has been clear and forceful that he wants to put judges on the bench with diversity that had been lacking in past, and that’s not just in terms of race and other markers but that diversity in professional background is just as important,” said peter markowitz, a professor at the cardozo school of law at yeshiva university.“you can’t just have judges that were former prosecutors,” he added. “we need former defense attorneys and other actors in the legal system represented on the bench as well.”a failure to do so under the trump administration has led to an imbalance in the system, garcía hernández said.“people who work as immigration lawyers and immigration defense lawyers develop a different perspective than people that work as immigration prosecutors,” he said.some of that can be seen in the number of asylum case denials, which surged under trump as judges denied petitions from those arguing they would face danger if they returned to their home country due to things like their race, religion or political beliefs. denial rates that had hovered around 50 percent under prior administrations jumped closer to 70 percent.“all but one of these new judges were former prosecutors, law enforcement, or in other branches of government, demonstrating a clear lack of diversity and little change from hires made under the trump administration whose bench had the highest rate of asylum denials in history at 72 percent,” greg chen, director of government relations for the american immigration lawyers association, told the hill by email.“the biden administration is rushing to hire more judges to address the massive 1.3 million backlog in cases, but on its own more judges won’t fix the fundamental lack of fairness in the immigration courts which is why attorney general [merrick] garland must immediately institute reforms to restore the court’s integrity,” he said.doj pushed back against criticism that the new judges would contribute to a pattern of rulings that favor government attorneys over immigrants, saying it “takes seriously any claims of unjustified and significant anomalies in adjudicator decision-making and takes steps to evaluate disparities.”“note also that the executive office for immigration review (eoir) continually evaluates its processes and procedures to ensure that immigration cases are adjudicated fairly, impartially and expeditiously and that its immigration judges uniformly interpret and administer u.s. immigration laws,” the spokesperson said.• jacobin writer: biden extending elements of trump's 'war on asylum'• biden's relationship with top house republican is frostybut schmidt said diversifying the attorneys on the bench is what will be needed to have a greater impact.“you need to get some progressive immigration experts into the system who recognize what good asylum claims are who can establish precedent for granting cases and then move those cases through the system,” he said.“i haven't seen much evidence to back up their initial claim they want to be fair and just to asylum seekers. it’s just stephen miller lite.”"},"all_text":{"0":"Biden’s top diplomat makes unannounced stop in Afghanistan after president calls for troop withdrawal KABUL — Secretary of State Antony Blinken made an unannounced stop in Afghanistan on Thursday for meetings with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, civic leaders and the National Reconciliation Chairman Abdullah Abdullah to reassure them that Washington’s support for the war-torn country will continue despite the U.S. decision to withdraw all military forces by Sept. 11. Blinken’s trip follows the decision by President Biden on Wednesday to bring all remaining 2,500 U.S. troops home and end a conflict that has bedeviled his predecessors for the past two decades. Despite their long-standing concerns about a U.S. departure, Afghanistan’s leaders publicly embraced Biden’s decision and thanked officials for their coordination ahead of the announcement. In a meeting room in Kabul’s ornate presidential palace, Ghani told Blinken, “We respect [President Biden’s] decision and are adjusting our priorities.” In his meeting with Abdullah, the chairman said the withdrawal merely represented a new “chapter” in the U.S.-Afghan relationship. Blinken said he “wanted to demonstrate with my visit the ongoing commitment of the United States to the Islamic Republic and the people of Afghanistan.” “The partnership is changing but the partnership itself is enduring,” he said. Biden will withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, 2021 Looming behind every discussion in Afghanistan is the specter of a possible Taliban takeover of Kabul following the U.S. departure in the fall. For years, the United States tried and failed to apply military and political pressure in Afghanistan in hopes of persuading the Taliban to forge a resolution with the U.S.-backed Afghan government. With few options left, U.S. officials hope that a decisive withdrawal may jump-start the peace process rather than push the country further into violence as some have forecast. The meeting with Afghan officials face-to-face won’t be easy, said analysts. “No matter how you slice it, the withdrawal announcement will be hard for many Afghans to accept. There’s no way to sugarcoat a policy decision that’s quite likely to worsen instability in a country that has been at war for 40 years,” said Michael Kugelman, an Afghan scholar at the Wilson Center. “U.S. officials’ best bet is to assure Kabul and the Afghan people that a military withdrawal does not equate to a total abandonment,” he added. That’s precisely the message a senior State Department official said would be conveyed. “The American commitment is strong; we’re ending our direct military role, but that doesn’t mean we’re ending our relationship,” the official said. Following his meetings with Ghani and Abdullah, Blinken met with members of Afghan civil society, including journalists, a member of parliament and women’s rights leaders who stand to be affected by the U.S. departure. While waiting for Blinken to arrive, Afghanistan member of parliament Naheed Farid expressed concern about the future of her country. “My views are very pessimistic,” she said, without elaborating. Ahead of the meeting, the State Department official acknowledged that the civil society leaders “will be apprehensive about what will change” as U.S. and NATO forces exit the country. “Already they’re in a challenging position,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive political situation. “There’s a war going on right now. There have been targeted killings in the past month or so. Some of [the killings] done by the Taliban, some of them by done by the [Islamic State].” The stop in Afghanistan is an important step in what the Biden administration is calling a responsible winding down of the conflict. Blinken flew to Afghanistan from Brussels, where he and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made the case to European and Canadian allies that it was time to bring the 10,000-strong NATO mission to a close, a pitch that garnered unanimous support from the 30-member military alliance. In remarks at NATO headquarters, Blinken and Austin said the United States will continue to pay the salaries of Afghan security forces, help them maintain counterterrorism capabilities and provide significant humanitarian and economic assistance to the country. “We’ll continue support for the rights of Afghan women and girls, minorities advocating for their meaningful participation in the ongoing negotiations and their equal representation throughout society, and we’ll maintain significant humanitarian assistance to those in need,” Blinken said. During a press conference in Kabul, Blinken was asked how the United States will avoid a redux of the late 1980s, when the West largely forgot about Afghanistan following the Soviet Union’s withdrawal. Blinken said the difference is the U.S. will not forget, and he reiterated his vow to provide “support” to the Afghan military and civil society while applying diplomatic pressure to bring countries in the region together to “advance peace.” While Afghanistan’s leaders put a positive spin on the U.S. decision, Blinken, too, glowingly praised the economic and cultural progress in Afghanistan in recent years despite its crippling poverty, endemic corruption and recurring violence. In a meeting with U.S. soldiers at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Blinken noted their achievements. “What you and your predecessors did over the last 20 years is really extraordinary,” he said. A key challenge for U.S. officials has been trying to midwife peace talks between the Taliban and the U.S.-backed Afghan government. The stalemated discussions are supposed to resume in coming days in Istanbul. The Biden administration’s decision to withdraw prompted immediate criticism from Republican leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina, who argued that the U.S. would lose its leverage to force concessions from the Taliban. Biden took on those criticisms in his speech on Wednesday, saying time has proved such arguments to be wrong. “I know there are many who will loudly insist that diplomacy cannot succeed without a robust U.S. military presence to stand as leverage,” Biden said. “We gave that argument a decade. It’s never proved effective — not when we had 98,000 troops in Afghanistan, and not when we were down to a few thousand.”","1":"U.S. could have 300 million extra vaccine doses by end of July, raising concerns about hoarding The United States is on track to have gathered an oversupply of hundreds of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses as soon as July, even while many countries in the developing world will have to wait years to vaccinate a majority of their populations, according to a report by the Duke Global Health Innovation Center.

Some 49% of U.S. adults say Trump’s accounts should be permanently banned from social media, while half say they should not be. But views are deeply divided along partisan lines, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.  The survey, fielded April 12 to 18, was conducted before Facebook’s independent oversight board upheld for now the suspension of Trump’s account that was instituted in the wake of the violent riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Several social media companies acted against Trump after the attack, claiming he violated their terms of use and that his rhetoric could result in more violence. Republicans and Democrats hold deeply contrasting views of a lifetime ban for Trump. Just 11% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say Trump’s accounts should be permanently banned from social media, while 88% say they should not be. By comparison, 81% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say his accounts should be banned permanently. Roughly one-in-five Democrats (18%) do not support this type of ban on Trump’s accounts.  While most Republicans do not support permanently barring Trump from social media, there are some ideological differences within the party. More than nine-in-ten conservative Republicans (95%) believe Trump’s accounts should not be permanently banned from social media, but that share is lower among moderate and liberal Republicans (77%). Among Democrats, liberals (85%) are somewhat more likely than conservatives and moderates (78%) to favor a permanent ban, though large majorities in both ideological groups favor it. The Center’s new poll follows a January survey that gauged public reactions to the initial bans that social media companies imposed on Trump after the Capitol riots. In that survey, 58% of adults said they thought social media companies’ decisions to ban Trump’s accounts in the wake of the riots were the right thing to do, while 41% believed those decisions were the wrong thing to do. And then – just like today – most Republicans (78%) said social media companies’ decisions to ban Trump’s accounts following the riots were the wrong thing to do, while a vast majority of Democrats (89%) supported these decisions. Facebook created its oversight board in 2019 to be the final arbiter of important, controversial content decisions made by the platform. It began making decisions earlier this year. The board recently ordered Facebook to reinstate a post that accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of participating in efforts to kill the country’s Sikh religious minority.","5":"Leslie Marshall: Mother's Day amid COVID – I know how hard this year's been, give yourself a pat on the back This Mother’s Day, I would like to take a moment to congratulate all the moms who made this past year possible. Of course, I know it wasn’t just mothers. Fathers, guardians, caregivers and more made this possible, but Sunday is Mother’s Day so I would like to focus on the moms. A year ago March, I had just flown back from New York and Washington, D.C., where I would fly twice a month to do Fox programs on set. The school notified us by email that we needed to pick our children up, with all of their things (backpacks, school supplies, computers), because they would be shutting the school down due to this new virus that was going around called COVID-19.   To be honest, I thought the children would be home two or three weeks max, then back to school and back to normal life as we knew it. Boy, was I wrong! It would be a year or longer for most. I am sure many of you have experienced some of what I went through; some of you much more. I would like to list a few of the challenges we moms faced this past year during the pandemic. Although a painful reminder for some, hopefully one that is in our rearview mirror forever. The day after I picked my children up at school, they had to start attending school online. This was a challenge as I am technologically not inclined, perhaps even techno phobic. The children were also not accustomed to a class via zoom.  There were distractions, such as our dog barking and needing attention, my children arguing that one could hear the other’s classmates, the temptation of hitting up the pantry or the fridge too much and the temptation of YouTube, Netflix, Facetime all during class. As one child recently told President Biden, online learning was an opportunity to nap during school at times.  And then there was the internet. Or lack of. Once my children and I finally got the handle on the new school online schedule and the various ways one submits classwork (Zoom, Google Classroom, Membean and more), there were Wi-Fi issues.  In our home, this caused an issue for my job. ","6":"The Anti-War Origins of Mother’s Day Antolini, the author of “Memorializing Motherhood: Anna Jarvis and the Struggle for Control of Mother’s Day,” talked to Vox about the origins of the holiday: [Jarvis] selected the second Sunday in May because it marked the anniversary of her mother’s death and she wanted Mother’s Day to always fall on the Sabbath. Her vision of motherhood stayed constant through the years for a couple of reasons. “A lot of it is that Anna herself never marries or has children. She has no idea what motherhood means from the eye of the mother,” Antolini says. “It was very much seeing motherhood through the eyes of a child.” Jarvis retreated from her mother’s socially conscious vision for Mother’s Day in favor of one that idolized the mother’s individual role. Jarvis’ Mother’s Day celebration soon spread to other cities. In 1914, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson issued a presidential proclamation to officially establish Mother’s Day as a national holiday.  Wilson invited the American public to display flags “on the second Sunday in May as a public expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country.” Flowers, Cards, and Commercialization. In the first few years after Jarvis’ 1908 Mother’s Day celebration, she promoted the holiday by, for instance, lobbying florists and card companies to promote the holiday. While these efforts largely helped Jarvis achieve her goal of establishing a national holiday, she would later speak out against the commercialization of Mother’s Day. ","7":"Biden fills immigration court with Trump hires The Biden team has hired a slate of immigration judges initially selected during the Trump era, angering advocates who argue the White House is already failing to deliver in its pledge to push back against the prior administration's shaping of the judiciary.The first 17 hires to the court system responsible for determining whether migrants get to remain in the country is filled with former prosecutors and counselors for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as well as a few picks with little immigration experience. Almost none have made their career representing migrants in court.The Thursday announcement from the Department of Justice (DOJ) initially perplexed immigration attorneys, advocates and even some former immigration judges who wondered why the group so closely mirrored the jurists favored by the Trump administration.“The 17 new immigration judges referenced in the notice all received their conditional offers under the prior administration,” a Justice Department spokesperson told The Hill.Critics said the Biden administration has an obligation to fully vet the judges hired under their watch and rebalance a court system heavily shaped by the Trump team.It’s also a surprising move for a president that has otherwise sought to quickly reverse a number of Trump immigration policies while calling for a more humane response to migration.“This is a list I would have expected out of Bill Barr or Jeff Sessions, but they're not the attorney general anymore. Elections are supposed to have consequences,” said Paul Schmidt, now an adjunct professor at Georgetown Law School after 21 years as an immigration judge. That included time serving as the chair of the Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest administrative body dealing with immigration cases.“No one on that list is among the top 100 asylum authorities in the country, and that's the kind of people they should be hiring — not prosecutorial re-treads,” he added. Under the Trump administration, the Justice Department, which oversees the immigration court system, filled roughly two-thirds of the 520 seats on the bench, often picking those with long careers in ICE who argue in favor of deporting people.“The Trump administration was very astute when it came to the importance of who sits on the bench. That was as true of the Supreme Court as it was all of the federal circuits and the federal district courts, and to their immense credit they did not have a blind spot for the immigration court,” said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a professor at the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law.“I think it's important for the administration actually putting these individuals on the bench to decide if they have the information they need to make this decision or delay the process or to take ownership for making these appointments,” he added. Biden’s budget calls for hiring 100 new immigration court judges — a figure many argue will hardly make a dent in a backlog of 1.3 million cases that will take an estimated four years to get through.And his designated White House counsel wrote in a letter to lawmakers in December seeking suggestions for who to nominate to the bench, writing that they were “focused on nominating individuals whose legal experiences have been historically underrepresented on the federal bench, including ... those who represent Americans in every walk of life.”For many, that means the immigration court system needs to be filled with more immigration defenders.“The bottom line is that the president has been clear and forceful that he wants to put judges on the bench with diversity that had been lacking in past, and that’s not just in terms of race and other markers but that diversity in professional background is just as important,” said Peter Markowitz, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.“You can’t just have judges that were former prosecutors,” he added. “We need former defense attorneys and other actors in the legal system represented on the bench as well.”A failure to do so under the Trump administration has led to an imbalance in the system, García Hernández said.“People who work as immigration lawyers and immigration defense lawyers develop a different perspective than people that work as immigration prosecutors,” he said.Some of that can be seen in the number of asylum case denials, which surged under Trump as judges denied petitions from those arguing they would face danger if they returned to their home country due to things like their race, religion or political beliefs. Denial rates that had hovered around 50 percent under prior administrations jumped closer to 70 percent.“All but one of these new judges were former prosecutors, law enforcement, or in other branches of government, demonstrating a clear lack of diversity and little change from hires made under the Trump administration whose bench had the highest rate of asylum denials in history at 72 percent,” Greg Chen, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told The Hill by email.“The Biden administration is rushing to hire more judges to address the massive 1.3 million backlog in cases, but on its own more judges won’t fix the fundamental lack of fairness in the immigration courts which is why Attorney General [Merrick] Garland must immediately institute reforms to restore the court’s integrity,” he said.DOJ pushed back against criticism that the new judges would contribute to a pattern of rulings that favor government attorneys over immigrants, saying it “takes seriously any claims of unjustified and significant anomalies in adjudicator decision-making and takes steps to evaluate disparities.”“Note also that the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) continually evaluates its processes and procedures to ensure that immigration cases are adjudicated fairly, impartially and expeditiously and that its immigration judges uniformly interpret and administer U.S. immigration laws,” the spokesperson said.• Jacobin writer: Biden extending elements of Trump's 'war on asylum'• Biden's relationship with top House Republican is frostyBut Schmidt said diversifying the attorneys on the bench is what will be needed to have a greater impact.“You need to get some progressive immigration experts into the system who recognize what good asylum claims are who can establish precedent for granting cases and then move those cases through the system,” he said.“I haven't seen much evidence to back up their initial claim they want to be fair and just to asylum seekers. It’s just Stephen Miller Lite.”"},"content_summary":{"0":"kabul — secretary of state antony blinken made an unannounced stop in afghanistan on thursday for meetings with afghan president ashraf ghani, civic leaders and the national reconciliation chairman abdullah abdullah to reassure them that washington’s support for the war-torn country will continue despite the u.s. during a press conference in kabul, blinken was asked how the united states will avoid a redux of the late 1980s, when the west largely forgot about afghanistan following the soviet union’s withdrawal.","1":"the united states is on track to have gathered an oversupply of hundreds of millions of coronavirus vaccine doses as soon as july, even while many countries in the developing world will have to wait years to vaccinate a majority of their populations, according to a report by the duke global health innovation center.","2":"facebook’s oversight board decided wednesday to uphold facebook’s and instagram’s suspension of former president donald trump from their platforms. whether it’s the president of the united states or an average american citizen in des moines, big tech should not have the ability to suppress viewpoints it finds objectionable—and it certainly shouldn’t have the ability to hide behind outdated laws in justifying such behavior.","3":"donald trump remains banned from facebook inc. had trump been reinstated, his facebook feed would most likely have featured familiar menu items: self-regard, pitches for money and his business, darts aimed at critics, disinformation, and appeals to bigotry, racism and other bile.","4":"americans are split on whether former president donald trump should be barred from social media. more than nine-in-ten conservative republicans (95%) believe trump’s accounts should not be permanently banned from social media, but that share is lower among moderate and liberal republicans (77%).","5":"this mother’s day, i would like to take a moment to congratulate all the moms who made this past year possible. fathers, guardians, caregivers and more made this possible, but sunday is mother’s day so i would like to focus on the moms.","6":"antolini, the author of “memorializing motherhood: anna jarvis and the struggle for control of mother’s day,” talked to vox about the origins of the holiday: [jarvis] selected the second sunday in may because it marked the anniversary of her mother’s death and she wanted mother’s day to always fall on the sabbath. in the first few years after jarvis’ 1908 mother’s day celebration, she promoted the holiday by, for instance, lobbying florists and card companies to promote the holiday.","7":"the biden team has hired a slate of immigration judges initially selected during the trump era, angering advocates who argue the white house is already failing to deliver in its pledge to push back against the prior administration's shaping of the judiciary.the first 17 hires to the court system responsible for determining whether migrants get to remain in the country is filled with former prosecutors and counselors for immigration and customs enforcement (ice) as well as a few picks with little immigration experience."}}
